## Local Development 

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed. Also, install the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for managing Node.js versions.


### Initial Setup

Begin by ensuring that the appropriate version of Node.js for the project is installed and in use:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

Next, install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

If you're using a Mac, you may want to adjust Docker's RAM allocation (minimum of 4GB). To do so, click on the Docker icon in the toolbar, open "Preferences," and then navigate to "Resources" to adjust the settings.

### Accessing the Local Development Environment
You can access your development environment at:

The Next.js app will be available at http://localhost:3000
